1. I found the getCString function was the most challenging to define. First, getChar was already a new thing in this exercise. Second, obtaining a string as input meant it was a more elaborate function than obtaining a single character. It was about using the pointer properly to obtain input, clearing the char array, as well as taking care of the number of characters in the string (a minimum, maximum, or an exact number of characters). I saw a little bit of mistyped things in a1ms2.c too such as a dollar sign for household income and "enter the password". They were not exactly central to coding, but it was also part of clearing errors for a "clean" final product. Other than the relatively new concepts of character and string, the rest was what we already had in the previous work.

2. I think the library of functions in general is helpful for organization. That is, the functions stay in a particular file for constant review. In the main code where the main process is, it only takes effort to cite the respective functions that work as subprocesses. This is about promoting modularity between the main process and subprocesses. If changes are necessary, changes are easy to do in each specific area, whether they are in the main process or a certain subprocess. Ultimately, this is almost a necessity when coding tends to become long and complicated. Whether it is about debugging or other maintenance activities, modularity in this way helps.

3. One advantage is the use of structs enables the designers to utilize modularity and change things in an organized manner (as in the above). People can access the structs as if they were plain English words and symbols. It is possible to encapsule multiple kinds of data in structs and it is flexible. There are probably a few limitations of this practice. People need to define struct data types whenever they need to. Those types were not included in c itself. There is no way to use operators in the structures.
